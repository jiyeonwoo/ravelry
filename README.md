# Ravelry Analysis
A python-based data storytelling project. Here I analyzed 200 of the most popular yarn lines on [Ravelry](ravelry.com) to see what makes a yarn popular, combining product attributes with user insights. 

## Background and Business Task
Ravelry is a popular platform with over 10 million users, serving as a hub for fiber artists to track their projects, yarns, and patterns. In recent years, knitting and crocheting have experienced a revival, especially among millennials and Gen Z. This resurgence has been driven partly by the search for calming hobbies during the pandemic, as well as a broader cultural embrace of DIY and sustainable living. Public figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Olympic diver Tom Daley, and actor Ryan Gosling have helped normalize and popularize fiber arts as well. Combined with a niche but active online community on platforms like TikTok, it's clear that yarn holds a significant place in the craft supply market.

This project aims to highlight trends in fiber types, brand, yarn weight, texture, washability, and user satisfaction to uncover what makes certain yarns so well-loved by fiber artists.
