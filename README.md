# Ravelry Analysis
A python-based data storytelling project. Here I analyzed 200 of the most popular yarn lines on [Ravelry](ravelry.com) to see what makes a yarn popular, combining product attributes with user insights. It highlights trends in fiber types, brand, yarn weight, texture, washability, and user satisfaction to uncover what makes certain yarns so well-loved by fiber artists. 

To run this notebook yourself, you'll need an .env file with a CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET from Ravelry. You can get started with the Ravelry API [here](https://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravelry-api).
